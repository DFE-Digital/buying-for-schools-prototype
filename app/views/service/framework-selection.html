          How frameworks are selected
        </h1>

        <p>The Schools Commercial Team (SCT) within DfE reviews a range of frameworks. These frameworks are assessed for:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>value for money</li>
          <li>compliance with procurement regulations</li>
          <li>ease of use</li>
          <li>suitability for schools</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feedback from schools is also considered when selecting frameworks.</p>
        <p>SCT continues to review and add to the list of recommended frameworks.</p>
