          Who should assess the bids
        </h1>

        <p>It&rsquo;s best to have at least 2 people assess each bid. When they&rsquo;re finished they should compare their scores and:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>discuss where they&rsquo;ve scored differently</li>
          <li>reach an agreed score</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This process is called moderation. Be aware, the more people involved, the harder it can be to reach an agreed score.</p>

        <p>Bring in a specialist if you need expert knowledge to assess a criteria.</p>

        <p>You may also ask the framework owner when they last ran a financial check on the supplier. Ask them to run a new one if needed.</p>
