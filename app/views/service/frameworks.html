        <p>The Schools Commercial Team (SCT) within DfE reviews a range of frameworks. These frameworks are assessed for compliance with procurement regulations, ease of use, suitability and value for money. Feedback from schools is also considered when selecting frameworks.</p>
        <p>SCT continues to review and add to the list of recommended frameworks.</p>
